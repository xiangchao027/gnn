# gnn
Growing Neural Networks Library
Theory : Network Growing and Pruning. 
Network topology is generated or driven by a input data model.
No fixed form of topology network can fit all models of data, so
GNN is created, to fit the data model automatically.

GNN is also named as ANN(Automated Neural Network)
